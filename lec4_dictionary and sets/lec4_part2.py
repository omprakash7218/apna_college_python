#  METHODS IN DICTIONARY AS WE HAVE STUDIED FOR LIST , STRINGS , TUPLES 

print(asian_paints.keys())   # It gives dict_keys, we can change this to list , tuples etc 
print(asian_paints['exterior'].keys())  # this conversion is known as type cast
print("\nend of the line ")
print(tuple(asian_paints.keys()))

print(str(asian_paints.keys()))

print(list(asian_paints.keys()))

# print(int(asian_paints.keys()))  it gives an error 
# print(float(asian_paints.keys())) it will also give an error
print(bool(asian_paints.keys()))

# we can also know total number of keys

print(len(asian_paints))
print(len(list(asian_paints.keys())))


print(asian_paints.values())
#we can do the conversion herea also. list , bool etc

print(asian_paints["interior"].items())
#it gives tuple of items in the dictionary

print(asian_paints.get("exterior"))
# it gives values of key

# print(asian_paints["abc"])            # it gives an error
print(asian_paints.get("abc"))     # it gives a none but code runs without giving an error
